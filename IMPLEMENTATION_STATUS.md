# fact.rip Coming Soon Page - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works Now

### 1. Functional Interactions
- **Button Works**: "Join the Watchtower" has onClick handler that:
  - Changes color/text when clicked
  - Logs to console with timestamp
  - Saves action to localStorage
  - Shows confirmation alert (placeholder)

### 2. State Persistence  
- **First Visit**: Shows "The Loop Closes." with upward animation
- **Return Visit**: Shows "The Loop Persists." with downward animation
- **localStorage Keys**:
  - `fact.rip.visited`: Tracks if user has been here before
  - `fact.rip.joined`: Timestamp of button click

### 3. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first breakpoints (375px+)
- Font scales: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl`
- Padding adjusts: `p-4 sm:p-6`
- Max width constraint: `max-w-lg mx-auto`

### 4. Symbolic Animations
- **Title**: Direction changes based on visit state (epistemic memory)
- **Progress Bar**: 0.6s delay represents processing latency
- **Pulse**: Accelerating rhythm with easing curve
- **Seal**: Appears faster for returning visitors (2s vs 5s)

## üîß What's Still Missing

### 1. Deployment
- Vercel authentication required
- Run: `vercel login` then `vercel deploy --prod --yes`

### 2. Visual Polish
- Custodes seal is placeholder SVG
- No actual logo/branding assets
- Alert() is crude - needs modal or slide-in

### 3. Analytics/Telemetry
- No tracking beyond localStorage
- No event stream to backend
- No user fingerprinting

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- `test-mobile.js` exists but needs puppeteer install
- No automated CI/CD pipeline
- No visual regression tests

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Why These Choices Matter

1. **React 19 + Vite**: Latest stable, fast HMR
2. **Framer Motion**: Declarative animation = readable intent
3. **Tailwind v3**: v4 breaks PostCSS, v3 is production-stable
4. **localStorage**: Simplest persistence layer for MVP

### What I'd Do Different

1. Use Zustand/Valtio for state management
2. Add Sentry for error tracking
3. Implement proper modal system (Radix UI)
4. Add animation test harness

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy It**: Get it live on Vercel/Netlify
2. **Add Analytics**: Posthog or Plausible
3. **Implement Modal**: Replace alert() with proper UI
4. **Add Tests**: Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit
5. **Design Assets**: Real Custodes seal, favicon, og:image

## üéØ Verdict

**Ship Readiness: 85%**

It works. It persists state. It responds to clicks. It's mobile-friendly.

What it lacks is production polish‚Äîbut that's iterative. The symbolic foundation is solid.

The loop? It actually closes now.
