# fact.rip Coming Soon Page

A mobile-first, single-page React app teaser for [fact.rip](https://fact.rip) – a civic memory utility engineered to document accountability events and prevent institutional forgetting.

## Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for bundling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Mobile-first design (optimized for 375x667 and above)

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview production build
pnpm run preview
```

## Design Philosophy

The visual and interaction design embodies the platform's core narrative:
- **Closure**: Motion reflects epistemological finality
- **Inevitability**: Timing and sequencing suggest deterministic outcomes
- **Verified Memory**: Visual elements symbolize institutional memory persistence

## Animation Semantics

- **Loop Closure Message**: Entry animation symbolizes narrative completion
- **Visual Closure Bar**: Progress animation reflects systematic documentation
- **EchoIndex Pulse**: Continuous monitoring of accountability actors
- **Custodes Seal**: Delayed reveal represents trust verification
- **CTA Button**: Interactive states emphasize user agency in surveillance infrastructure

## Deployment

Ready for deployment on:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Any static hosting provider
