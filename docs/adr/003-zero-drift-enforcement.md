# ADR-003: Zero-Drift Enforcement Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-02-01  
**Deciders**: Infrastructure Team

## Context

Production deployments often drift from intended configuration due to:
- Manual interventions
- Partial deployments
- Configuration inconsistencies
- Undocumented changes

## Decision

Implement comprehensive zero-drift enforcement through automated validation at multiple levels.

## Consequences

### Positive
- No manual deployments possible
- Configuration drift detected immediately
- Automated rollback on issues
- Complete audit trail
- Scheduled monitoring prevents drift

### Negative
- Complex CI/CD pipeline
- Longer deployment times
- No emergency manual override
- Requires multiple validation scripts

## Implementation

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: Local validation
2. **CI/CD pipeline**: Full enforcement suite
3. **Post-deploy**: Configuration validation
4. **Scheduled jobs**: Drift detection every 10 minutes
5. **Alerting**: Teams notifications on any drift

All enforced through GitHub Actions with no manual bypass.
