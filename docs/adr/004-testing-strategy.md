# ADR-004: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-02-15  
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

We need a testing strategy that:
- Ensures high code quality
- Catches bugs before production
- Validates accessibility requirements
- Tests failure scenarios
- Runs efficiently in CI/CD

## Decision

Implement a multi-layer testing approach with:
1. Unit tests (Vitest) for logic
2. E2E tests (Playwright) for user flows
3. Accessibility tests (axe-core) for WCAG compliance
4. Adversarial tests for error scenarios
5. Visual regression tests (planned)

## Consequences

### Positive
- High confidence in deployments
- Early bug detection
- Accessibility guaranteed
- Error handling validated
- Fast feedback loops

### Negative
- Longer CI/CD pipeline
- More test maintenance
- Higher initial development time
- Complex test infrastructure

## Implementation

### Test Structure
```
src/
  components/
    Modal.test.tsx      # Unit tests
e2e/
  user-journey.spec.ts  # E2E tests
  accessibility.spec.ts # A11y tests
```

### Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage
- E2E tests: All critical paths
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA
- Performance: Core Web Vitals

### CI/CD Integration
1. Pre-commit: Type checking, linting
2. PR: Full test suite
3. Post-merge: Deployment tests
4. Scheduled: Performance monitoring
